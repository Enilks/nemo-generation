* Ask ChatGPT and see if it can generate a guardrails file with something similar to the above prompts? (Note: above reffering to things on the Notion doc)
  * This one is not really working with the colang file
  * Give ChatGPT example colang and stuff to help it learn how the colang shape works
  * Try to convince ChatGPT to give me the responses I want based on that. Giving it examples and teaching and stuff
